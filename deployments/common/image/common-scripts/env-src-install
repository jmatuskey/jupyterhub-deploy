usage:  env-src-install  <environment>   <pkg>

This script installs a src tarball downloaded from a URL.  It is ideally suited
to installing source tarballs from PyPi as a way of building binaries which are
tailored to a particular JH environment and associated dependency solution.

Step 4+ of pip-tools workflow: When forced by incompatible PyPi binaries, build
compatible binaries from source and install into <env>.

Nominal pip-tools workflow:

    1. /opt/common-scripts/env-conda  <env>     # Create minimal conda environment.
    2. /opt/common-scripts/env-compile <env>    # Resolve pip dependencies to requirements.txt
    3. /opt/common-scripts/env-sync  <env>      # Download and install requirements.txt
    4+ /opt/common-scripts/env-src-install  ... # Build package binaries from source.
    ...
