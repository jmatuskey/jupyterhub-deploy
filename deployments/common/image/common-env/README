This directory contains files which are nominally installed in every environment.
Currently this is done with the  /opt/common-scripts/install-common script.

IMPORTANT: It's recommended to keep these files at a minimum because the
likelihood of dependency conflicts increases as more files are added and may
affect any of the other deployments.  Conflicts can be sidestepped either by
dropping new conflicting files or inlining variations of install-common in
the problem deployment.
